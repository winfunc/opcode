Feature: Add session deletion functionality

Implements session deletion feature with delete button on hover for each session card.

Addresses issue #305 where users requested the ability to delete unnecessary sessions.

## Changes:
- **Backend**: Added `delete_session` Rust command to remove .jsonl files and associated todo data
- **Frontend**: Added `deleteSession` API method with proper error handling
- **UI**: Added Trash2 icon delete button that appears on session card hover
- **UX**: Added confirmation dialog before deletion to prevent accidents
- **State**: Updated local state management to remove sessions immediately after deletion

## Features:
- Hover-to-reveal delete button for clean UI
- Confirmation dialog with session details
- Deletes both session file and associated todo data
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Follows project coding standards and documentation guidelines

## Testing:
- ✅ Code compiles without errors
- ✅ Follows project linting standards (cargo fmt, cargo clippy)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation added
- ✅ UI integration tested
